# dot-files
##Backup of my Linux dot files

###Applications using these dot files:
	TMUX - .tmux.conf
	VIM - .vimrc
	BASH - .bashrc

###Tips for Use
1) Create symlinks to these dot files from your home directory:
ln ~/dot-files/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln ~/dot-files/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln ~/dot-files/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

2) Only update the files inside the ~/dot-files repository

Goal: To try to keep my configurations as minimalistic, yet productive as possible
